1.Data structures that are contained within a single cache-line are more efficient.
2.Use appropriate containers.
3.Use smaller data types.
4.Beware of the standard dynamic memory allocator, which may introduce holes and spread your data structure and algorithm design.
5.Avoid algorithms and datastructures that exhibit irregular access patterns, and favor linear data structures.
